# Alexnet-tensorflow


This repository contains an implementation of AlexNet convolutional neural network.

#### train
python multigpu_train.py

if you want to use other train data instead of Dogs vs Cats(link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GoFCwLs8hetPdPdqdCnRPA passcode:pxkx), you may need to modify file: readdata.py

#### test
python test.py
